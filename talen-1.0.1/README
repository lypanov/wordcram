See the file COPYING.fdl for copying conditions.

To use me, just copy the "data" directory
onto a new directory "lessons". 

Run the program as follows:
   cd <the directory into which you installed>
   ./trainer.py lessons/les.aa

An idea is to install it into your home directory
then add a "alias" to your .bashrc file, 

   alias 'nl $HOME/nl/trainer.py $HOME/nl/lessons/les.aa'

Where "less.aa" is your current lesson.
When your think your good enough at a given
file you can simply change this to "ab" for example.
