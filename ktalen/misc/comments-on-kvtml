the description at the top of the file is pointless. why not have it at the bottom??? - DONE
the wierd numbers present in the files seem completely pointless, width, lines, for example, whats the point of those??? - DONE
number of columns makes sense though. this though is just really a way of formalizing the comma'd lists of verb conjugations for example
however, the columns are pretty pointless on second thought, as u really want it to be dynamic in any case. so lets remove that - DONE
there are *wayyy* too many sets in the file. each set should have around 25 words or so. sets are seriously the wrong way of
going about it therefore. and rather than that sets should be split up into two more useful metadata elements: topic groupings and difficulty ratings
the xml format is far from self documenting, this is bad bad bad
some elements of the t field in e are not even documented!, "re" being just a simple example
