Read COPYING, as this program is under it :)

This program does interesting things that you can read about it <THENREADME>
when i get around to doing it...

At the moment the only language available is dutch, as thats the one i'm 
studying currently. I'll hopefully add spanish, french and german as soon as i
get the required resources...

Directory structure:

	src/									source + object files
		JVocabTrainer/					java version
			JVocabTrainer.java		console version (complete)
			VocabTrainerApplet.*		appletized version (unworking)
		gVocabTrainer/					pygnome version (incomplete)
	common/								langauge data files
		nl/								dutch language files
	user/									user data

Credits to the bloke who did the orginal html dictionary on which <nl/basic>
is based.

To compile move to <src> and type:
	javac JVocabTrainer.java
then execute it:
	java JVocabTrainer <filename>

Copy the language directory you require from <common> into <user>.
Then exec JVocabTrainer with the wanted file from <user>.
This will keep a current version in that file rather than the original file.

As well as the built-in lessons, you can make your own stuff up and send it 
to me to include in the next distribution ;)

Send any comments and patches to {bueno@beer.com} or {kelletta@usa.net} if 
that doesn't work...
